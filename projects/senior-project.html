          Our client was a nature based preschool that relied on pen and paper to keep reports. The reports were then typed for individual emails to be sent to each guardian. Our proposed 
          solutions was to automate the process with a web based application. Mock student data was used initially to test functionality. 
        </p>

          <b>Methodology: </b> The analytics portion was designed to view activity trends, track friends between students, and student absences. Data was pulled from the database using SQL. 
          The dynamic charts were created with JavaScript. 
          <br><br>A chart was created based on whether a pie chart or line chart was selected from the dropdown. 
          <br><br>The pie chart explored student activities and student friends. The default view showed how many times all students participated in an activity over a certain period of time.
          Activities with a total less than 5% were not given a label but hovering over each would give all details on that activity. 
          Individual students could be selected to see their activities they participated in or friends.

          The line chart tracked activity trends and absences over a period of time in order to identify seasonal trends.
